A Remote sensor shield that fits over a second generation Raspberry Pi and allows a XBee S2 Zigbee transciever, a BMP085 pressure sensor, a DS1820 1-Wire temperature sensor nad a ThingM BlinkM to be connected.

The XBee connects to the Pi's ttyAMA0 serial interface, the DS1820 uses 1-wire on a GPIO port, the other devices use i2c (3.3v and 5v with translation) on i2c port 1.
